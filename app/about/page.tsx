        Most folks online know me as <b>Stevie IsMagic</b>.
        The pen name is a remnant from a time when it was unnatural to share personal details with strangers on the internet.
        (Anyone remember the original meaning of a/s/l in those early 2000's AOL chatrooms?) My back sure does hurt while writing this..

          I find writing to be one of the kindest forms of artistic expression. And I wish to share more of the knowledge I've aquired on my journey as a human being.
          Sir Isaac Newton once said that if today we see further than others, it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants.
          IMO, we each owe it to the world to share our knowledge and experiences. Could you imagine our predecesors never shared
          any of their ideas for the betterment of humanity? What kind of world would we live in today?

          I'm passionate about many creative pursuits, including music, writing, painting, and of course, thinking!
          This combination of interests is what ultimately led me to my current professional role writing software.
          I've always felt a deep desire to have a seat at the roundtable of persons actively building the future.
          And I feel honored to live in an age where the tools to positively impact a generation are readily at my fingertips.

          I'm currently working on a handful of projects that I'll slowly share with you soon as I build out this site.
          My most important one involves helping my parents actualize their life dreams.
          It's the least I can do for the two people who have literally given me their everything.
          Stay tuned for more details..

          Outside of creative pursuits, I'm a aspiring <b>beach bum</b> and <b>yogi</b>.
          The sea is a source of great peace and inspiration for me. I am, after all, a water sign y'all. ~
